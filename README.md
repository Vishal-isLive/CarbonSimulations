# Carbon Credit Simulation 

## What are carbon credits?
They can be defined as a permit which allows a country or organization to produce a certain amount of carbon emissions and which can be traded if the full allowance is not used.

# The simulation
* Each ball represents a unit of carbon emissions in the atmosphere
* Carbon emissions are produced by the factory by a random time interval
* If a ball comes in contact with the renewable energy source (lower right corner), it is removed from the atmosphere and "netted"
* Overall emissions are displayed in the table, and D3 timegraph
